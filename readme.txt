Generates a simple sitemap for your site.

== Description ==

Generates a simple sitemap, listing the page and posts on your site.  You can set which page will become your sitemap, and the sitemap will be automatically inserted with your regular page content.

This plugin is useful in helping your visitors find their way around the site, and is beneficial for search engines crawling your site.

July 2024 - Plugin now comes with a Gutenberg compatible block, allowing you to choose which post-types to show sitemap links for.  The earlier functionality & shortcodes continue to work unchanged.

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin to your wordpress installation plugin directory
1. Activate plugin through the `Plugins` menu in Wordpress
1. Look at the configuration screen (found under `Settings` in the Wordpress menu)
1. Choose which page to show the sitemap on, and tick which pages or post-categories you wish to exclude from the sitemap.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the order in which Pages are listed? =
Pages are listed according to 'menu order'. When you edit pages, you can set the Order.  There are plugins available which let you drag/drop pages to set your preferred order.

= Are pages displayed hierarchically? =
Yes - if you have pages & subpages, they will be listed as an indented list.

= Can I change the order in which Posts are listed? =
No.  Posts are listed from newest to oldest, and are not grouped by category.

= Can I display my blog posts grouped by category? =
No, I haven't build that feature yet.

= How do I use the shortcode to show my custom post-type? =
<code>[simplesitemap view="POST_TYPE"]</code>
