# Simple Sitemap

A WordPress plugin to generate a simple sitemap - a list of links of all pages/posts on your site.  You can choose to auto-insert onto a page, or insert via shortcode.

This plugin is useful in helping your visitors find their way around the site, and is beneficial for search engines crawling your site.

## SVN Deployment

I'm trying to use a Github workflow to auto-deploy tagged commits from git to the SVN Plugin Repository.
